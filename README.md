# wifi-Dashboard
1. Setting Up the Project Environment
The first step is to set up the environment for development and install the required dependencies.

1.1 Creating a Virtual Environment (Recommended for Development)
Using a virtual environment helps you manage dependencies for your project without affecting other projects on your system.

Create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source venv/bin/activate
1.2 Installing Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries as specified in your requirements.txt, or you can install libraries manually:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt, you can generate it by running:

bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Dependencies to Install:

Flask or Dash (for the Dashboard UI)

Prometheus-client (for metrics collection)

psutil (for network usage data)

ping3, speedtest-cli (for network testing)

sqlite3 (for database management)

scapy (for sniffing traffic)

schedule (for scheduling tasks)
1.3 Setting Up the Database
Make sure to set up your SQLite database or choose a different one (if needed). The setup_database() function in your code will handle creating the database and tables if they donâ€™t exist already.

2. Building the Project (If Needed)
For this project, most of the work is done by running Python scripts directly. However, if you need to build an executable or package it for deployment, you can use the following options:

2.1 Creating an Executable (Optional)
If you want to create an executable file for Windows, you can use tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

Install PyInstaller:

bash
pip install pyinstaller
Create the executable:

bash
pyinstaller --onefile app.py
2.2 Build Using Docker (If Required)
If you want to use Docker to containerize your application:

Create a Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Build the Docker image:

bash
docker build -t wifi-analyzer .
Run the container:

bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 wifi-analyzer

3. Recommendations for Further Development
Testing: Write unit tests for critical parts of your code, such as the functions that handle metrics collection or database interactions.

Additional Features: You can add features such as alerting when specific metrics exceed thresholds, or expose APIs to allow external systems to pull data from your app.

Scalability: For production environments, consider using a more robust database like PostgreSQL and optimizing the collection of metrics to handle larger data volumes.
